# Study — RESUME HERE

**What this is.** Study = the interactive trading-education product inside The Desk → Courses: a
"Duolingo for stocks" (Foundations, 13 tracks + Vocabulary) and the firm's own system (The UCT
Method) drilled on real charts, with no AI at runtime, every item reviewed by the owner.

**Authority, in order:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-desk-practice-interactive-education-design.md`
(§13 overrides earlier sections; §11 + §13.9 hold every owner decision) → `docs/study/plan-review.html`
(the owner-facing plan page, saved locally) → this file (state + next actions).

**Owner rulings that govern the work (2026-10-17):**
- Launch Study **only when it is all done and complete** (not tied to the site's 2026-11-14 opening).
- Owner is **full time** on review until it is done; reviews **every item of a type until 20-30 clean
  examples**, then the review screen asks whether to switch that type to auto-approve + sample.
- **Save everything locally, resumably** — this branch/worktree is the save file. Commit at every
  checkpoint. Artifacts are copies, never the only copy.
- No AI in the product at launch; lessons written in sessions; no model writes a market fact.

## State (update this block at every checkpoint)
- Branch `feat/study`, worktree `C:\Users\pgosz\uct-worktrees\study` (owner file present), based on
  master `f2e816e042` (2026-10-17). Nothing merged to master. Nothing deployed. **NOT pushed to
  origin yet** (push blocked for the AI session; owner runs `git push -u origin feat/study`).
- Python: `.venv/` in this worktree (Python 3.12, requirements + pytest installed 2026-10-17).
  Run tests as `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/<named files> -q -p no:cacheprovider`.

- Phase 0: ALL 8 FILES DRAFTED. Awaiting the owner's one-session review (see "Owner review packet").
- Phase 1 backend: skeleton in progress by an engineering lane (api/services/study_*.py,
  api/routers/study.py, tests/test_study_*.py); it commits with pathspecs on api/tests only.
- Content bank: 0 items. Unit plan: Foundations 116 units (~2,970 q) + Vocabulary 13 units
  (~2,920 q) + Method 96 units (~5,605 q). Both curricula authored in parallel.

## Owner review packet (Phase 0 — read in this order, one session)
1. `docs/study/VOICE.md` — the voice rules derived from your Substack/Scans prose; §8 open items.
2. `docs/study/UNITS-foundations.md` — 129 units; read "Gaps for the owner" (8 content gaps +
   a thin-data table). Notable: 1929 and 1973-74 can only be authored (index bars start 1974);
   Greeks units need hand-frozen past chains; F7.05 waits on the wire-archive tier backfill.
3. `docs/study/UNITS-method.md` — 96 units; all 79 course lessons linked, 6 "covered in part"
   need your sign-off; the 28-setup roster with supply (6 good · 12 medium · 5 thin · 6 none);
   "Source facts that differ from the spec" (34 templates not 48; a 4th setup vocabulary in the
   archive; VCP/Flat Base/HTF/EP/PEG/U&R/Remount have 0 real-bar fixtures; 21- vs 17-mistake
   audit; course drawdown protocol vs your published ladder).
4. `docs/study/skill_map.json` — the machine map (28 setups with aliases, 106 lesson links).
5. `docs/study/sizing_rule.md` — confirm the drawdown ladder (§4) and "under 1% is normal".
6. `docs/study/pass_bars.md` — the proposed bars.
7. `docs/study/video_toolchain.md` — approve Option A and the voice source.
8. `docs/study/VOICE_CONSENT.md` — sign before any voice sample is used.

## Phase 0 checklist (owner signs off each file in one session)
- [x] `docs/study/VOICE.md` (draft 22980148dc, awaiting owner sign-off) — derived from the owner's own prose (toolkit cards, morning-wire
      `data/voice/voice_exemplars.json` + `voice_profile.json`, methodology bible, playbooks; Desk
      transcripts and Substack issues once read from the server).
- [x] `docs/study/UNITS-foundations.md` (draft ab7a0efbbe, 129 units) — every unit for F1–F12, F2b, V with what it teaches, rungs,
      example needs, course lesson covered.
- [x] `docs/study/UNITS-method.md` (draft 1a6b3da6cb, 96 units) — every unit keyed on the course JSON's 16 modules + Calls +
      Overlay, with the per-setup supply table (28 setups) and the loss source per setup.
- [x] `docs/study/skill_map.json` (draft 1a6b3da6cb) — curricula → tracks → units → skills, ids, lesson_key links,
      28-setup aliases to the other vocabularies.
- [x] `docs/study/sizing_rule.md` (draft 22980148dc, owner to confirm §4 ladder) — §4.11 as the single sizing authority; toolkit card regenerated from it.
- [x] `docs/study/pass_bars.md` (proposal 22980148dc) — proposed checkpoint bars for owner decision.
- [x] `docs/study/video_toolchain.md` (proposal 22980148dc) — intro-video pipeline proposal with per-video cost.
- [x] `docs/study/VOICE_CONSENT.md` (template 22980148dc; unsigned) — consent template for the voice clone (owner signs before any sample).

## Build checklist (Phase 1, per spec §7 + §13.2)
- [ ] `api/services/study_store.py` (schema §6.1/§7.1 + §13 corrections: literal STUDY_DB_PATH read,
      one BEGIN IMMEDIATE per attempt, study_terms, trust_state per item type)
- [ ] `api/services/study_scoring.py`, `study_select.py` (3 due slots + random mix), `study_mastery.py`,
      `study_templates.py`, `study_import.py` (get_bars_before only; misses reported; number-grounding
      + banned-phrase checks)
- [ ] `api/routers/study.py` (local `require_paid`, `STUDY_ENABLED` default ON read per request,
      bars-by-item, image proxy, attempts, step, today (bars inline), practise, leaderboard, review,
      import, corrections export)
- [ ] `api/main.py` lifespan init + jobs (reminders claim-row, weekly close w/ catch-up,
      gen_detections after 02:00 ET; NO 06:30 fan-out)
- [~] Outside-Study prerequisites (their own small merges): wire_archive persists `exposure_tier` (DONE ad2f95cbf9);
      StockChart `studyMode` / `armedTool` / `toolsAllowlist`; hub hidden under a fullscreen Sheet;
      `/api/ticker-meta` short-circuits non-universe symbols; one-time Scans image copy to R2 (SCRIPT DONE 1a6b3da6cb: `scripts/study/copy_scans_images.py`, not yet run on the pod).
- [ ] Frontend: StudyPanel + trail sub-view inside CoursesSection, fullscreen DrillPlayer (one chart
      per session), drills, reveal panel, end card, Practise sheet, StudyReview admin mode.
- [ ] Tests: `tests/test_study_store.py`, `test_study_scoring.py`, `test_study_no_sym_leak.py`,
      `test_study_import.py`, `test_study_flags.py`; frontend `StudyPanel.test.jsx`, `DrillPlayer.test.jsx`.

## Resume procedure
1. `cd C:\Users\pgosz\uct-worktrees\study && git status && git log --oneline -5`
2. Read this file's State block, then the spec §13 and §11/§13.9.
3. Continue the first unchecked item above. Commit at every checkpoint with a message starting `study:`.
4. Re-measure every count cited in the spec before relying on it (they drift).
