# Object lane vs TradingView — triage of the 36 diverging captures (2026-09-28)

**Source of the verdicts:** the 47 live captures in
`C:/Users/Patrick/AppData/Local/uct-vendor-batch/runs/ext-2026-09-28/captures/`
(NYSE:RDDT 1D, 632 bars each), graded by
`app/src/components/chart/engine/__tests__/vendorHarness/vendorHarness.corpus.test.js`
with `VITE_PINE_OBJECTS_ONLY_PANE_ENABLED=1`. Baseline re-run in this worktree at
`a07c83fe7` reproduces the batch's `grade-all47/verdicts.json` exactly:
**objects MATCH 11 / 47, object families agreeing 161 / 252.**

A "family" is one of the seven comparisons `compareObjects` makes per script
(counts of lines, labels, boxes, tables, table cells; texts of labels and cells).

## How the root causes were found (evidence, not reading)

Every class below was established from one of these instruments, run over all 47
captures (none is committed; they were throwaway vitest files and a temporary
`globalThis`-gated capture in `pine.js::canonicalOf` / `guardOf`, restored by
byte capture afterwards):

* **drop census** — `translation.objectDiagnostics.dropReasons` per script, plus the
  refusal message of every tree `canonicalOf` could not resolve;
* **guard columns** — every op's `when` column evaluated over the 632 bars
  (`truthy k/632`), which is what exposed the object lane's unread `isconfirmed`;
* **id parity** — TradingView numbers drawing objects with ONE monotonic counter,
  and so does `objectRuntime` (`nextId`). Where our creation sequence is the
  vendor's, the ids agree exactly (e.g. `ultimate-pivot-points`: vendor holds line
  ids 11218..11313, our uncapped run created ids up to 11322 in the same order), so
  "which objects does TradingView still hold" is answerable per id, not guessed.

## The classes

| class | what it is | scripts (primary) | general fix? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** | vendor study metainfo arrives HTML-escaped (`Pivot High&#039;s`, `Makuchaku&#039;s`) — **titles only**: no object text in the 47 captures carries an entity | extrapolated (plot titles) | yes, harness |
| **C2** | the object lane is deaf to `newestBarIsForming` — `objectReaderFor` passes `tf` and inputs to `interpret` but not the bar-close tri-state, so `barstate.isconfirmed`/`ishistory`/`isrealtime` are `na` in every object tree while the plot beside it reads them | liquidity-pools, trend-duration | yes, engine |
| **C3** | `linefill.new` on a pair that already has a fill replaces it (Pine manual, Fills); a fill between `na` lines holds nothing | liquidity-pools | yes, runtime |
| **C4** | a table created at a position that already holds one replaces it; we treated tables as an 8-deep house envelope and REFUSED the whole run | heat-map-seasons, ict-ipda-look-back | yes, runtime |
| **C5** | string escape `\n` lexed as the letter `n` | position-size-calculator, heat-map-seasons (+ trend-duration, max-pain, liquidity-heatmap once reachable) | yes, lexer |
| **C6** | several statements on one line separated by commas (`a, b, c`) — only the all-bindings case is split; a line mixing calls/`var`/`:=` keeps its last statement in a function body and is left whole at top level | position-size-calculator, extrapolated (secondary) | yes, object reader |
| **C7** | vendor garbage collection is BATCHED, not strict: a create past `cap + 5` cuts the family back to `cap`, oldest first, sparing the running bar's creates and `var`-held objects — measured by id on the `vw-object-gc-*` probes (§ C7) | makuchaku, ultimate-pivot-points, multi-timeframe-supply-demand-zones | **yes, engine — done** (`c5e63beea`, step 9) |
| C8 | clock builtins we do not hold: `time_close`, `timeframe.change`, `chart.left_visible_bar_time` (the last is viewport state and unanswerable) | liquidation-levels, poor-man, rsmi, adr, htf-footprint, sector-rotation | needs a declared clock column each |
| C9 | a history offset that is an expression (`x[bar_index - k]`) | artemis, extrapolated, smt-divergence | large — the columnar lane requires literal windows by design |
| C10 | `request.security` in object text/coordinates | artemis, ema-ribbon, linear-regression, vold | large — needs the MTF data seam |
| C11 | arrays / UDTs / methods holding drawings or values | dual-view, htf-liquidity, KZP, smc, k-clustering, max-pain, PTA, trend-duration, vdubus | large |
| C12 | values or `var` state computed across a multi-statement block | atr-sr, market-structure, rsi-swing, position-size-calc | large |
| C13 | user drawing functions the inliner refuses (`in-expression`, `conditional-history`, `loop`) | adr, OHLM, TSR | medium, per refusal kind |
| C14 | object getters in a coordinate or guard | (secondary) rsi-swing, ultimate, trend-duration | medium |
| C15 | text builtins / constants in value position (`str.format`, `size.*`, `position.*`) | (secondary) | small each |
| C16 | `table.merge_cells` | momentum-volatility-scanner | small |
| C17 | ~~a function definition read inside a guard~~ — no script's primary cause once `liquidity-heatmap` was traced to C10 | — | — |
| **C19** | `for i = a to b by s` — the reader refused any stepped loop whole (the loop op had no step); found while re-grading after C4, as what still held `heat-map-seasons`' gauge cells (`loopBlocked: table.cell`) | heat-map-seasons | yes, reader + runtime |

## Fix order (scripts fixed per change) and results

Each fix is general Pine semantics with a focused test and a control that fails
without it; each row below is a full re-grade of the 47 captures.

| step | class | commit | objects MATCH | families agreeing | scripts that moved |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | — | `a07c83fe7` | 11 / 47 | 161 / 252 | — |
| 1 | C1 metainfo HTML decode (harness) | `925bc50e0` | 11 / 47 | 161 / 252 | none on objects (by construction); `extrapolated-pivot-connector`'s two plots go UNMAPPED → mapped and compared (630/632 bars agree) |
| 2 | C4 table replaces the table at its position | `f1b86c777` | 12 / 47 | 165 / 252 | `ict-ipda-look-back` 4/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (lines 3, boxes 6, tables 1 — the run no longer stops at bar 8); `heat-map-seasons` 4/7 → 5/7 (tables 1/1; cells still short — C5 + a loop-blocked `table.cell`) |
| 3 | C5 `\n` escape is a newline | `4ba2ee1ec` | 12 / 47 | 165 / 252 | no family flips yet, and the reason is measured: the text family compares MULTISETS, so a right text in a wrong count still disagrees. The divergent strings are gone — `heat-map-seasons` cells `onlyOurs` ['☀︎ - Summern❆ - Wintern…'] → [] ; `position-size-calculator` labels `onlyOurs` 8 × 'n Account Balance…' → [] (its count, 4/50, is C6) |
| 4 | C6 comma-joined statements split for the object reader | `a2697d89c` | 13 / 47 | 167 / 252 | `position-size-calculator` 5/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (labels 4/4 and texts, with C5); `extrapolated-pivot-connector` still has no program — its top-level `label.delete(a[1]),…` now reads, but every create sits behind C9 |
| 5 | C2 the object lane receives `newestBarIsForming` | `f20c2d6c3` | 14 / 47 | 171 / 252 | `liquidity-pools` 4/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (lines 182, labels 91 and their texts); `trend-duration-forecast-chartprime` 2/7 → 3/7 (lines 1/1; its labels/cells sit behind C11) |
| 6 | C3 one linefill per pair of lines, none without them | `82c0e2029` | 14 / 47 | 171 / 252 | linefills are not a graded family, so the score cannot move; measured directly instead: `liquidity-pools` fills 500 → **91 = vendor 91**, `price-action-…` 19 = vendor 19 (unchanged), `linear-regression-…` 2 → 0 against vendor 2 — its two fills had been attached to lines we never draw (C10), so the old 2 was a coincidence of counts, not a drawing |
| 7 | C19 `for … by <step>` carried as the loop's step | `7564906d3` | 15 / 47 | 173 / 252 | `heat-map-seasons` 5/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (cells 31/31 and their texts, with C4 + C5). Side effect, measured and kept: `sonarlab-order-blocks` (committed corpus, not in this batch) has `for … by 1` delete loops; they are READ now and their array-size bounds are not, so its loss moved from a reader-level block (no drop counted) to a counted `loop:bounds` drop — still refused at the member door, now as "a loop that deletes", and no longer (falsely) clean in the host lane. Three rails that pinned the old accounting were re-pointed, and the "lost before conversion" class kept a synthetic `while` fixture because no committed script shows it any more |
| 8 | C16 `table.merge_cells` carried (reader → runtime → render state → DOM `colSpan`) | `554f78d85` | 16 / 47 | 175 / 252 | `momentum-volatility-scanner` 5/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (cells 12/12 — the covered (1,0) cell is held, empty, as the vendor holds it); `average-day-range-adr-pivots` cells 2 → 3 of 4 (its merged cell reads now; the missing cell is the one `cell:text` drop the census records — not traced further) |
| 9 | C7 the object collector is batched (`cap + 5` → `cap`, sparing the bar and `var`-held objects) | `c5e63beea` | 19 / 47 | 180 / 252 | `makuchaku039s-…` 6/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (boxes 51/51), `ultimate-pivot-points` 4/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (lines 51/51, labels 51/51), `multi-timeframe-supply-demand-zones` 6/7 → **7/7 MATCH** (boxes 504/504) — all three id for id; `contraction-box` stays MATCH at 50; no other family moved. The 8 probe captures: 0/8 → 6/8 objects MATCH, 19/42 → 42/42 families (D is refused at the door) |

### Where the lane stands

**Objects MATCH 11 → 19 of 47; object families agreeing 161 → 180 of 252.** Steps
1–8 took it to 16 / 175 and step 9 (C7) to 19 / 180. Before C7, five
scripts flipped to MATCH (`ict-ipda-look-back`, `position-size-calculator`,
`liquidity-pools`, `heat-map-seasons`, `momentum-volatility-scanner`); two more
moved without flipping (`trend-duration-forecast-chartprime` 2 → 3 of 7,
`average-day-range-adr-pivots` cells 2 → 3 of 4), and `high-low-open-mid-ranges`
now holds 13 of its 45 cells (was 1). Every step is one commit with a focused
test and a mutation proof; the 31 scripts still diverging are listed below by
what would move them.

## C7 — the vendor's garbage collection: measured by id, and IMPLEMENTED (2026-09-28)

TradingView documents `max_*_count` as approximate ("the count is approximate;
more drawings than the specified count may be displayed"). It is approximate
only when read by COUNT. Read by id it is exact, and it is one rule:

> **A create that takes a family past `cap + 5` deletes the OLDEST objects of
> that family until `cap` remain — skipping any object created on the running
> bar and any object a drawing variable currently holds. Skipped objects still
> count.**

So the held count saw-tooths between `cap` and `cap + 5`, and where it sits at
the end is the phase of the last bar — which is why the six corpus rows looked
like six rules. Implemented once, in `objectRuntime`'s create (`collect()`),
the only collector either lane runs; the constant is `objectPool.GC_BATCH = 5`.
Commit `c5e63beea`.

### The probes, and what each capture held (ids from `tv_capture.js`)

Probes `tools/visual_conformance/probes/vw-object-gc-{a,b,c,d}.pine`
(`203d43609`), captured live on AMEX:SPY 1D (8,473 bars, last bar 8472) and 1W
(1,758 bars, last bar 1757) at full history, `57ae9e7c1`. One id counter serves
every family, so each bar's ids are decodable from the per-bar call order in
the probe headers; box and label texts carry the bar.

| capture | family (cap) | TradingView held | = |
|---|---|---|---|
| A 1D | boxes (50) | 55: `AB 8418` … `AB 8472`, ids 35778 … 36007 | the newest 55 boxes |
| A 1D | labels (50) | 55: `AL 8256` … `AL 8472` by 4s, ids 35090 … 36008 | the newest 55 labels |
| A 1D | lines (50) | 51: bars 8456 … 8472 × widths 1,2,3, ids 35941 … 36011 | the newest 51 lines |
| A 1W | boxes / labels / lines | 54 (`AB 1704`…`1757`) / 51 (`AL 1560`…`1756` by 4s + `AL 1757`) / 54 (bars 1740…1757 × 3) | newest 54 / 51 / 54 |
| B 1D | boxes / labels / lines (50) | 55 `BB 8418`…`8472` / 55 `BL 8418`…`8472` / 51 (bars 8456…8472 × 3) | newest 55 / 55 / 51 |
| B 1W | boxes / labels / lines (50) | 54 `BB 1704`…`1757` / 54 `BL 1704`…`1757` / 54 (bars 1740…1757 × 3) | newest 54 / 54 / 54 |
| C 1D | boxes (3) | `CB KEEP-VAR` (id 1), `CB KEEP-SET` (id 2), `CB 8472` (id 25419) | two `var` boxes from bar 0 + the newest one |
| C 1D | labels (5) | 9: `CL 8460, 8462, 8463, 8465, 8466, 8468, 8469, 8471, 8472` | the newest 9 LIVE (the ≡ 1 mod 3 ones were deleted) |
| C 1D | lines (7) | 11: id 25421 solid w2 + ids 25422 … 25431 dotted w1 | every line of the last bar, nothing older |
| C 1W | boxes (3) | 8: `KEEP-VAR`, `KEEP-SET`, `CB 1752` … `CB 1757` | two `var` boxes + the newest 6 |
| C 1W | labels (5) | 8: `CL 1746, 1748, 1749, 1751, 1752, 1754, 1755, 1757` | the newest 8 live |
| C 1W | lines (7) | 11: id 5276 solid + 5277 … 5286 dotted | every line of the last bar |
| D 1D | labels / boxes / lines (5 / 3 / 7) | 7 (bars 8466 … 8472, ids 8483 … 8489) / `DB 1`…`DB 6` (ids 1–6) / ids 7–16 | newest 7 / the whole bar-0 burst / the whole bar-0 burst |
| D 1W | labels / boxes / lines | 6 (bars 1752 … 1757) / `DB 1`…`6` / ids 7–16 | newest 6 / whole burst / whole burst |

**Probe D is the rule read directly** — `label.all` before and after each bar's
create (cap 5): 1, 2, … 10, then `10 → 5` on the next create, then 5 … 10 again,
every sixth bar from bar 10. **1,411 cuts on 1D and 292 on 1W, every one of them
exactly 10 → 5**; the count never exceeds 10. The bar-0 bursts (6 boxes at cap 3,
10 lines at cap 7) read 6 and 10 on every one of the 8,473 bars: they never pass
their own trigger (8, 12), so nothing ever collects them. The probe's
instrument check holds: the labels held at the end number D04's last value (7, 6)
and are the newest by id, so `*.all` is the collector's view.

### Hypotheses (letters from the probe headers)

| | rule | verdict | the evidence that decides it |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | strict ≤ cap (ours until now) | **refuted** | A/B hold 51–55 at 50; D's `label.all` reaches 10 at cap 5 |
| H2 | trim-then-add, cap + 1 | **refuted** | 55, 54, 9, 8 held |
| H3a | one trim at bar end, last bar trimmed | **refuted** | D: the cut happens INSIDE `label.new` (D03 = 10 before, D04 = 5 after, same bar) |
| H3b | trim at the next bar's start | **refuted** | D03, read at the start of a bar, reaches 10 — no trim ran there |
| H4 | a bar's own creates are spared | **kept, as a clause** | C lines: 11 held at cap 7 on both phases, all from the last bar. Without it the 1W reading is 10 and loses the solid line (the model and the engine both go red) |
| H5 | scope (`if` keeps one more) | **refuted** | A.O3 (in `if`) and B.O3 (global) hold identical bars on both timeframes |
| H6 | sporadic creation keeps one more | **refuted** | A.O2 vs B.O2 differ only by the phase of the count, which the batch rule predicts exactly |
| H7 | `na` coordinates collected differently | **refuted** | A.O1 (na coords on 4 bars of 5) and B.O1 hold the same bars: 8418…8472, 1704…1757 |
| H8 | LIVE count vs ring of created ids | **LIVE** | C labels reproduce id for id counting live objects; a ring model (a deleted label keeps its slot) predicts 5 and 4 against the 9 and 8 held |
| H9 | a `var`-held object is not collected (but counts) | **kept, as a clause** | C boxes: `KEEP-VAR` and `KEEP-SET` survive 8,472 bars at cap 3. "Exempt and NOT counted" predicts 9 on 1D against the 3 held |
| H9b | touched = recent (LRU) | **refuted** | `KEEP-VAR` is never touched after bar 0 and survives |
| H10 | lazy / batched | **kept — the core** | D's sawtooth, and the trigger is `cap + 5`: offsets 0–11 were scanned over all 24 families and only 5 fits every one |

⚠️ **Not separated by these probes, and decided by Pine's evaluation order
rather than measured:** whether `l := label.new(…)` still spares the OLD label in
`l` during that create (we collect before the register is written, so it does).
And "held" means a drawing variable's CURRENT value: an object reachable only
through a register's history (`cl[1]`) IS collected (probe C's labels), while one
held only in an array is unmeasured — probe D's array-held boxes never reach
their trigger, so they cannot tell. We do not spare array members.

### The same rule against the corpus

Ours after the change, id for id against the vendor on the RDDT 1D captures:

| script | family | cap | our creates (uncapped) | TradingView holds | ours now | ids |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `contraction-box-doji-lines` | boxes | 50 | 632, one per bar | 50 | 50 | **identical** (576 creates past the first cut ≡ 0 mod 6) |
| `makuchaku039s-trade-tools-fair-value-gaps` | boxes | 50 | 189, sporadic | 51 | 51 | **identical** (133 past the first cut ≡ 1) |
| `ultimate-pivot-points` | lines, labels | 50 | 5,661 each, nine per bar | 51, 51 | 51, 51 | **identical** (5,605 ≡ 1) |
| `multi-timeframe-supply-demand-zones` | boxes | 500 | 504, all on bar 0 | 504 | 504 | **identical** (never passes 505; also the bar's own creates) |
| `sector-rotation` | lines / boxes | 50 / 500 | lines 632; boxes unreachable (C8) | 50 / 504 | 50 / — | consistent, not reproducible: its boxes interleave the id counter, so our line ids are offset |
| `smt-divergence-…` | lines, labels | 500 | unreachable (C9) | 500, 500 | — | consistent (≤ 505) |
| `high-low-open-mid-ranges` | lines, labels | 500 | unreachable (C13) | 504, 504 | — | consistent (≤ 505) |

Every vendor count in all 47 captures is ≤ its cap + 5; none sits below its cap
while we create more. No family that matched before the change moved.

### Grades (harness, `VITE_PINE_OBJECTS_ONLY_PANE_ENABLED=1`)

| set | before (`57ae9e7c1`) | after (`c5e63beea`) |
|---|---|---|
| 47 RDDT captures — objects MATCH | 16 / 47 | **19 / 47** (+ makuchaku, ultimate-pivot-points, multi-timeframe S&D) |
| 47 RDDT captures — families agreeing | 175 / 252 | **180 / 252** |
| 8 gc captures — objects MATCH | 0 / 8 | **6 / 8** (D is refused at the door: `pine:collection`, `label.all`) |
| 8 gc captures — families agreeing | 19 / 42 | **42 / 42** |

⚠️ The three 1W gc captures still read DIVERGE overall, on a PLOT, not an object:
`*01_isconfirmed` is 0 on TradingView's last weekly bar (the week was still
forming at capture time) while the capture's `newestBarIsForming` says `false`,
so our side reads 1. That is capture metadata; the object verdict is MATCH on all
six. (The 1W files' own `id` field also says `-1d-`.)

The rail is `app/src/components/chart/engine/__tests__/objectCollector.vendor.test.js`:
the six probe captures id for id, probe D's sawtooth read off the vendor's own
plots, and the runtime lane one clause at a time, each with a control.
Mutation-proved four ways (byte capture + sha-verified restore): the spare-bar
clause removed (2 red), the held clause removed (3 red), `GC_BATCH` 5 → 4 (10
red), the collect call dropped (9 red).

## What is left, ranked by scripts it would move

| rank | class | scripts (primary) | what it needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | C11 arrays / UDTs / methods holding drawings or values | dual-view, htf-liquidity, KZP, smc, k-clustering, max-pain, PTA, trend-duration, vdubus (9) | the collection/UDT grammar in the object lane — the largest single gap, and a design wave rather than a fix |
| 2 | C12 values or `var` state computed across a multi-statement block (`pine:block`, `pine:state`, `pine:reassign`) | atr-sr, market-structure, rsi-swing, position-size-calc, smc (secondary) (4–5) | per-bar state for block-assigned names; `market-structure` and `smc` also OVER-draw because a reset (`x := na` after a draw) is lost, so this is the class that removes wrong objects, not just missing ones |
| 3 | C10 `request.security` in object text/coordinates | artemis, ema-ribbon, linear-regression, vold, liquidity-heatmap (5) | the MTF data seam reaching the object lane |
| 4 | C8 clock builtins: `time_close`, `timeframe.change` | liquidation-levels, poor-man, rsmi, adr, htf-footprint (5) | a declared clock column each, measured against the vendor — `time_close` on a daily bar is the session close, not the next open, so a guessed `time + 1 day` would misplace every label drawn at it |
| 5 | C9 a history offset that is an expression (`x[bar_index - k]`) | artemis, extrapolated, smt-divergence (3) | deliberately refused by the columnar lane (`pine:offset-literal`); needs the runtime lane or a bounded dynamic-offset node |
| ~~6~~ | ~~C7 vendor GC slack~~ | — | **done** (`c5e63beea`): all three MATCH id for id; see § C7 |
| 7 | C13 drawing functions the inliner refuses (`in-expression`, `conditional-history`, `loop`) | OHLM, TSR (+ adr secondary) (2) | per-refusal work in `objectFnInline.js` |
| 8 | C8 `chart.left_visible_bar_time` | sector-rotation (1) | not answerable on a bar series (it is viewport state) — a named refusal is the correct end state |
