#: Detectors whose output is computed and stored like any other (admins read
#: it) but must NEVER reach a member. Hardcoded on purpose: a flag that could
#: be flipped by an env var is a door; this is the capability itself. Every
#: member-facing read path filters these ids out (pattern_join, the raw
#: /api/patterns/{sym} branch for non-admins, memory.get_active_detections by
#: default, the voice and Compass pattern tools, the pattern backtest). An
#: internal id must also stay out of the member catalog (`_PATTERN_METADATA`).
#:
#: The first four trader-setup detectors (uct_kicker,
#: uct_oops_reversal, uct_slingshot, uct_hve) shipped here first; the owner
#: ruled them PUBLIC on 2026-10-15 (visible to every member and every tool).
#: The set and its call sites stay as the kill switch for any future internal
#: detector: add an id here and every member path drops it, no other edit.
#: Rail: tests/test_uct_internal_detectors_gate.py proves the gate with a
#: synthetic id, and that the four are visible on each member path.
