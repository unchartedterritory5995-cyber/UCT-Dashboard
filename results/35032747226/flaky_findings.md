# Flaky tests — DERIVED

⚠️ Written by `tools/ci_inventory.py --flaky`. **Not hand-edited, and not a quarantine list**: it is re-derived from the record on every run, so a test leaves it the moment the evidence stops supporting it.

**The rule (F-CI-30).** A test is FLAKY when the record shows it in BOTH states across two runs that no code change can distinguish — the same commit SHA, or a diff that cannot reach a test. It leaves after **5** consecutive stable runs. ⛔ There is NO rerun-on-failure anywhere in this pipeline.

| FLAKY_SIZE | FLAKY_NEW | FLAKY_FIXED |
|---|---|---|
| **49** | 44 | 0 |

## The pairs the record could compare

| runs | comparable | why |
|---|---|---|
| #15 → #16 | no | .github/workflows/full-suite-report.yml changed the suite-running job(s) pytest |
| #16 → #17 | no | .github/workflows/full-suite-report.yml changed the suite-running job(s) pytest; tools/ci_extract.py is referenced by 1 source file(s); tools/ci_summarize.py is referenced by 4 source file(s) |
| #17 → #18 | no | tools/ci_aggregate.py is referenced by 2 source file(s) |
| #18 → #19 | no | .github/workflows/full-suite-report.yml changed the suite-running job(s) pytest |
| #19 → #20 | **yes** | no changed file can reach a test |
| #20 → #21 | no | .github/workflows/full-suite-report.yml changed OUTSIDE `jobs:` — every job sees that |
| #21 → #22 | **yes** | no changed file can reach a test |
| #22 → #23 | **yes** | no changed file can reach a test |
| #23 → #24 | no | tests/test_ast_math_parity.py is referenced by 2 source file(s) |
| #24 → #25 | **yes** | no changed file can reach a test |

⛔ **4 of 10 consecutive pairs were comparable.** A pair that is not comparable contributes NO evidence in either direction — it cannot make a test flaky and it cannot clear one.
